This was named project9-Positioning on my computer


Stesps:
1. add a wrapper inside the header 

2. set the margin-top of .name to zero

3. set the margin-top value of main-nav to 5px

4.
.name a,
.main-nav a {
	text-align: center;
	display: block;
	padding: 10px 15px;
}


next is time for layout containers

5. 

.main-header {
	padding-top: .5em;
	padding-bottom: .5em;
}


6.

.banner,
.main-footer {
	text-align: center;
}

7. 

.banner {
	color: #fff;
	background: #3acec2;
	padding: 3.2em 0;
	margin-bottom: 60px;
}


8. 

.col {
	padding-right: 1em;
	padding-left: 1em;
}


next is time for page elements

9. 

.headline {
	margin-bottom: 0;
}

next is tiem to style the layout for larger screens using media queries

inside the @media (min-width: 769px) {   we add

.container {
		width: 90%;
		margin: 0 auto;
	}

	.name {
		float: left;
	}

	.main-nav {
		float: right;
	}

	.main-nav li {
		display: inline-block;
		margin-left: 15px;
	}

	.tagline {
		font-size: 1.4em;
	}





next, we style the column layout in medium and larger screens


float the columns to the lft by

.name,
.col {
  float: left;
}


for the medium-size screen, we only want two columns next to each other, so we give width to only the primary and secondary
columns.

.primary, 
.secondary {
width: 50%;
}


styling the layout for large screens

@media (min-width: 1025px) {
	.container {
		width: 80%;
		max-width: 1150px;
	}

	.primary {
		width: 40%;
	}

	.secondary,
	.tertiary {
		width: 30%;
	}	
}


solving the problem of collapsing containers

add the clearfix class to the container inside the main header and the container that holds all the columns



 

Create an Image Caption with Absolute Positioning

Add the <figure. tag inside primary col

 add the figure and figcaption rules to the css

next we want to position the caption over the image
position the figcaption element absolute, and position the figure element as relative


add the icon-location img inside the figure element in the html file, and add the .icon-location rule
in the Page Elements section of the css file

Fixed Positioning

next, you want to make your header and footer fixed
inside the first media query for the medium-size screen

.main-header {
		position: fixed;
		background: #fff;
		box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);
		width: 100%;
		top: 0;
		}

now, what's the resulting problem?
Fixed elements, just like absolute elements, are taken out of the normal document flow, so now it's covering the top of 
the banner. to fix this we add padding-top to the banner

inside the first media query for medium-size screens, we add

body {
padding-top: 68px;
}


z-index

what's the problem now? when you scroll down, the figure element covers the main-header element. to solve this, add this
to the main-header rule

z-index: 10; /*This could be any value larger than zero. we're just being cautious in case we want to add more elements 
later */


Note: z-index only works for elements with position of fixed, absolute, or relative

Note: when you give an element a z-index, you create a new positon context for the children of that element

Q. could it happen that an element with a higher z-index be positoned lower than an element with a lower z-index?
Ans. yes because that value is relative to the z-index of their parent element
